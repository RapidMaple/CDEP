Every LSID consists of up to five parts: the Network Identifier (NID); the root DNS name of the issuing authority; the namespace chosen by the issuing authority; the object id unique in that namespace; and an optional revision id for storing versioning information. Each part is separated by a colon.:In general, a namespace is an abstract container, which is or could be filled by names, or technical terms, or words, and these represent or stand for real-world things.  A description logic terminology namespace is a collection of Kind, Role, Property and Concept definitions.

Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA.

      <PREFERREDDEFINITION>GoMiner is a tool for biological interpretation of 'omic' data, including data from gene expression microarrays. Omic experiments often generate lists of dozens or hundreds of genes that differ in expression between samples, raising the question: &quot;What does it all mean biologically?&quot; To answer this question, GoMiner leverages the Gene Ontology (GO) to identify the biological processes, functions and components represented in these lists. Instead of analyzing microarray results with a gene-by-gene approach, GoMiner classifies the genes into biologically coherent categories and assesses these categories. The insights gained through GoMiner can generate hypotheses to guide additional research.:A word or expression used for some particular thing._A group of items of the same type, gathered for display or study.:Pertaining to an entirety or whole, also constituting the full quantity or extent; complete; derived by addition.:The sequences, mRNA transcripts, protein products, or other genome encoded molecules of the cell._Generic value domain for a primitive java dataype that is an Integer (32-bit two's complement).</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

In addition, tamoxifen up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor B (TGFb), a factor that inhibits tumor cell growth, and down-regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a factor that stimulates breast cancer cell growth. Tamoxifen also down-regulates protein kinase C (PKC) expression in a dose-dependant manner, inhibiting signal transduction and producing an antiproliferative effect in tumors such as malignant glioma and other cancers that overexpress PKC._The act of having given something (e.g., a medication or test)._Indicator of Yes, No, Unknown, Not Done, or Not Applicable to a question.[manually curated]</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

The targeted compound is selectively ionized, and its characteristic ions are separated from others in the mixture in the first mass spectrometer.

Tandem mass spectrometry can achieve specificities and sensitivities equivalent of those of methods such as radioimmunoassay and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, while performing analyses in much shorter times.

In addition, there are horizontal named realationships between concepts called Roles, binary relations between concepts that provide a machine-interpretable definition of a concept and the means for discrimination of sibling concepts. A concept may also include Properties, named slots that allow attachment of external information to concepts.:In UML modeling, an association that is also a class.
