By defining a simple, common way to identify and access biologically significant data, whether that data is stored in files, relational databases, in applications, or in internal or public data sources, LSID provides a naming standard underpinning for wide-area science and interoperability.

By defining a simple, common way to identify and access biologically significant data, whether that data is stored in files, relational databases, in applications, or in internal or public data sources, LSID provides a naming standard underpinning for wide-area science and interoperability.

The size of the particle determines the exact color of a given quantum dot. The polymer coating protects cells from cadmium toxicity but also facilitates the attachment of a variety of targeting molecules, including monoclonal antibodies directed to tumor-specific biomarkers. Because of their small size, quantum dots can function as cell- and even molecule-specific markers that will not interfere with the normal cellular functions._Brought into existence.:The particular day, month and year an event will happen or has happened._Generic value domain for a java datatype that represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

      <LONGNAME>Cytarabine Greater Than Integer::2 Gram per Square Meter per Day Administered Indicator</LONGNAME>
      <PREFERREDDEFINITION>An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair.
