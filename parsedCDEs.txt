EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pauseQuantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. NOTE(S): The pauseQuantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot; according to the definition above. The pauseQuantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pauseQuantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot;, i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

EXAMPLE(S): (1) Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pause quantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. (2) For the more complex examples of doing activity A 5 minutes after the start of B or 5 minutes after the end of B, use pause quantity in combination with &quot;completion required before starting indicator&quot; where the pause quantity in both cases would be 5 minutes and &quot;after the start of&quot; would be &quot;completion required before starting indicator&quot; = &quot;false&quot; and &quot;after the end of&quot; = &quot;true&quot;. NOTE(S): The pause quantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot; according to the definition above. The pause quantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pause quantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot;, i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pause quantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. NOTE(S): The pause quantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot; according to the definition above. The pause quantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pause quantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot;, i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

      <PREFERREDDEFINITION>The most common chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by neutrophilic leukocytosis.  It is associated with the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and/or the BCR/ABL fusion gene.  Most patients are middle-aged or elderly.  Common findings at presentation include fatigue, weight loss, anemia, night sweats, and splenomegaly.  The disease is bi- or triphasic; an initial indolent chronic phase is followed by an accelerated or blast phase.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative therapy (adapted from WHO 2001)._The grafting of tissues from one individual to another or place to place within a single individual._The continuum of experience in which events pass from the future through the present to the past._A phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia in which the peripheral blood smear shows leukocytosis due mainly to neutrophils in different stages of maturation.  Blasts usually account for less than 2% of the white blood cells counts.  The platelet count is normal or increased.  Thrombocytopenia is very uncommon during the chronic phase.  Most patients have mild anemia.  The bone marrow biopsy is hypercellular due to increased numbers of neutrophils and their precursors.  Blasts usually account for fewer than 5% of the marrow cells, and more than 10% indicates transformation to the accelerated phase.  Megakaryocytes are smaller than normal and have hypolobated nuclei.  The spleen is enlarged due to infiltration of the cords of the red pulp by granulocytes.

The disease is bi- or triphasic; an initial indolent chronic phase is followed by an accelerated or blast phase.  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is currently the only curative therapy (adapted from WHO 2001)._The grafting of tissues from one individual to another or place to place within a single individual._The continuum of experience in which events pass from the future through the present to the past._A phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia in which the peripheral blood smear shows leukocytosis due mainly to neutrophils in different stages of maturation.  Blasts usually account for less than 2% of the white blood cells counts.  The platelet count is normal or increased.  Thrombocytopenia is very uncommon during the chronic phase.  Most patients have mild anemia.  The bone marrow biopsy is hypercellular due to increased numbers of neutrophils and their precursors.  Blasts usually account for fewer than 5% of the marrow cells, and more than 10% indicates transformation to the accelerated phase.  Megakaryocytes are smaller than normal and have hypolobated nuclei.  The spleen is enlarged due to infiltration of the cords of the red pulp by granulocytes.

      <PREFERREDDEFINITION>A clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more of the hematopoietic cell lines.  The dysplasia may be accompanied by an increase in myeloblasts, but the number is less than 20%, which, according to the WHO guidelines, is the requisite threshold for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.  It may occur de novo or as a result of exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiotherapy.  (WHO, 2001)_Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders, characterized by proliferation in the bone marrow of one or more of the myeloid (i.e., granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic) lineages.  The proliferation is associated with relatively normal, effective maturation, resulting in increased numbers of granulocytes, red blood cells, and/or platelets in the peripheral blood.  CMPDs are primarily diseases of adults._A myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease which is characterized by persistent monocytosis, absence of a Philadelphia chromosome and BCR/ABL fusion gene, fewer than 20% blasts in the bone marrow or blood, and myelodysplasia.  (WHO, 2001)_Any abnormal condition of the body or mind that causes discomfort, dysfunction, or distress to the person affected or those in contact with the person. The term is often used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, syndromes, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function._The grafting of tissues from one individual to another or place to place within a single individual._A specific point in the time continuum, including those established relative to an event._An abatement in intensity or degree (as in the manifestations of a disease)._A condition or state at a particular time.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pauseQuantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. For the more complex examples of doing activity A 5 minutes after the start of B or 5 minutes after the end of B, use pauseQuantity in combination with completionRequiredBeforeStartingIndicator where the pauseQuantity in both cases would be 5 minutes and &quot;after the start of&quot; would be completionRequiredBeforeStartingIndicator = &quot;N&quot; and &quot;after the end of&quot; = &quot;Y&quot;. NOTE(S): The pauseQuantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot; according to the definition above. The pauseQuantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pauseQuantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot;, i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

      <PREFERREDDEFINITION>A quantity of time falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies the elapsed time between when an activity is ready for execution and the actual beginning of the execution. EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pause quantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. NOTE(S): The pause quantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot; according to the definition above. The pause quantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pause quantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is &quot;ready for execution&quot;, i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

This technique operates by exciting and recording signals from a range of magnetic resonance frequencies, allowing the identification and quantification of several biologically significant molecules containing proton groups that resonate in the appropriate frequency range. The technique facilitates observation of the spatial distribution of metabolic patterns over a region of interest and surrounding tissue at a high spatial resolution. Once executed and carried through to completion the date on which an observation was made or an event occurred is reported.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>
