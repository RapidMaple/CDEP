Note that this example assumes that the experimental unit is the subject (rather than a part of a subject or a group of subjects). An integer falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies how many times the activity occurs. NOTE(S): If the frequency is more than once a day, this is still interpreted per time, e.g. BID for 5 days = 10 repeats.</PREFERREDDEFINITION>

In general, only molecular ions of the analyte molecules are produced and almost no fragmentation occurs. This makes the method well suited for molecular weight determinations and mixture analysis.
