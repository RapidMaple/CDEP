NOTE(S): A randomization book is a predefined set of assignments to portions of a study based on criteria, such as stratum group for example, that ensures a desired distribution of subjects across those portions of the study. For example, the book entries indicate which arm a given subject, Joe, is assigned to based on the fact that he's the 5th person in stratum group #2. The textual representation of the planned activity from the point of view of a blinded participant (study subject or study investigator). EXAMPLE(S): During the second treatment epoch of a study, Arms A and B are still blinded and Arm C is no longer blinded. So, Arm A and B must have identical blindedDescriptions. In a study with 3 arms, Arm 1 - standard vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 2 - new vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 3 - new vaccine given in two shots at 2 months and 5 months of age. Subjects assigned to the third arm are unblinded at some point during 5 months and 12 months. By the time of the Third Shot Epoch, the &quot;Arm 3/Third Shot&quot; activity can be called by this, its unblinded name. However, the &quot;Arm 1/Third Shot&quot; and &quot;Arm2/Third Shot&quot; activities still need blinded names.
